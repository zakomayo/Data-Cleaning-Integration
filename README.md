# Data Integation and Reshaping

We have two tasks in this project. Firstly, we have to integrate data from various sources and create a specified final schema as given in the problem specification. Secondly, we have to observe the effects of normalizaion aand other transformations on some specific columns.

During the initial observation, the data seems to be of properties in the Victoria(AUS) region. Along with this are provided data of the various hospitals, supermarkets, shopping centres. Also PTV data of trains and train stations are provided. All this data has been used to ceate our final schema.

After getting our data, transformations have been done for analysis.
